# ML_Projects
## Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

### Description
This repository showcases my journey through learning Machine Learning (ML) fundamentals. The projects here reflect the implementation of various ML concepts that I've learned, starting from basic algorithms and progressively moving towards more complex ones. As I continue my learning journey, new projects will be added.

### Project Structure
Each project folder includes:
- Data preprocessing steps
- Model implementation
- Basic evaluation metrics
- Documentation of my learning process

### Learning Resources
These projects are developed while learning from:
- Andrew Ng's **Machine Learning Specialization**
- Various online resources and documentation
- Practice datasets from Kaggle

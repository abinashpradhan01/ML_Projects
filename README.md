## 📌 Project 1: **EduDrop – Predicting College Dropout Risk**

### 🎯 Objective
Predict whether a student is at risk of dropping out and suggest actionable interventions like counseling, financial aid, or academic support.

---

### 📊 Dataset
- [UCI Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)
- [Students Performance in Exams – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
- [Higher Education Dropout Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexandradeis/academic-performance-indicators)

---

### 🔨 ML Pipeline

1. **Data Collection & Merging**
   - Combine datasets or simulate additional features (like mental health, family support)

2. **EDA & Visualization**
   - Attendance, parental education, study hours, test scores
   - Correlation heatmaps, dropout trends

3. **Preprocessing**
   - Missing value imputation
   - Categorical encoding (One-Hot / Ordinal)
   - Feature scaling (StandardScaler / MinMax)

4. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest, XGBoost
   - Model comparison (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC)

5. **Interpretability**
   - SHAP for feature impact per student
   - Suggest interventions based on top factors

6. **Deployment**
   - Streamlit frontend: Upload student CSVs
   - Backend: Flask/FastAPI for model inference
   - Optional: PDF intervention report per student

## 🏥 Project 2: **SmartHealth – Lifestyle-Based Disease Risk Detection**

### 🎯 Objective
Predict health risks (diabetes, heart disease, mental health) using survey-style input data and generate personalized lifestyle recommendations.

---

### 📊 Dataset
- [BRFSS 2020 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system)
- [Diabetes Health Indicators](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset)
- [Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)

---

### 🔨 ML Pipeline

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Drop redundant features
   - Handle class imbalance (SMOTE, undersampling)
   - Encode categorical variables

2. **EDA**
   - Risk factors by age, gender, activity, BMI
   - Clustering similar health profiles

3. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN
   - Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
   - Multiclass risk prediction (if modeling multiple diseases)

4. **Interpretability**
   - SHAP-based explanation for each prediction
   - Display top 3 lifestyle changes

5. **Deployment**
   - Streamlit form: Takes 15 survey inputs
   - Outputs: Risk score + recommendations + explanation
